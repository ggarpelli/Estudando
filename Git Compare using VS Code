So, basically, you need to commit the first time to save a version of the file. Here's how I did it:
Initialize a local repository: git init
Add all files to the repository: git add .
Commit the changes with a commit message: git commit -m 'Your commit Message'
Then, I replaced all the files in the folder, and Git showed me the differences. I used the '+' arrow to add files one by one to the staging area, because if I use git add . again, it would add all files.
To add a particular file, use the following command: $ git add path/to/file
To add all changed files, use the following command: $ git add .
To add all changed files of a directory, use the following command: $ git add path/to/directoryOnly
Once you have finished adding all your changes, you can commit again, and now your new source of truth is the folder where you made the changes.
